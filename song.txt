Last Christmas, I gave you my cake
But the very next day, you stomped all over it
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to Indiana Jones

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the nativities glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

You were yummy
You were clean
Monarch of Miami
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
The crowd were swinging
All the children they were singing
You asked me to skip
And then we did kiss

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about fancy jewellery
I just want Indiana Jones for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true oh
All I want for Christmas is Indiana Jones
